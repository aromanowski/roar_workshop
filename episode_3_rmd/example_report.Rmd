## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Code chunks
## Input
You can also include code in code and the output of code in ‘code chunks’.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(2)

for(i in 1:length(x)){
  print(x[[i]])
}
```
# Inline code
```{r}
y <- mean(c(2,3))
x <- rbeta(1000,5,2)
```

The variable y takes on the value `r y`.
The mean of the observation is `r mean(x)`.
